PyTab is a simple Python-based desktop assistant that fetches quick summaries from Wikipedia using the wikipedia Python package. Built with wxPython for the graphical interface, the app lets users type any topic — such as a name, place, or concept — and returns a brief summary right inside the app.

The program uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python and focuses on basic input/output handling and user interaction. It is a very simple and clean application, with no complex backend — perfect for quick lookups.

This is my first complete project, created with the help of a Udemy tutorial, and represents the starting point of my journey in programming and project development.
